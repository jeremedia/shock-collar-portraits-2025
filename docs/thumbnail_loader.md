# OKNOTOK Thumbnail Loader

The OKNOTOK thumbnail loader is a reusable overlay animation that appears while thumbnails are fetched or processed. It presents the camp-themed 🆗 / 🚫 cross-fade, along with an orbiting red comet that collapses once the asset finishes loading.

## Usage

Embed the loader inside any thumbnail container that is already using the `lazy-images` Stimulus controller:

```erb
<div class="thumbnail-container" data-controller="lazy-images">
  <%= image_tag ... %>
  <%= render "shared/thumbnail_loader" %>
</div>
```

The shared partial wires up the required markup and target attributes:

```erb
<%= render "shared/thumbnail_loader" %>
```

The loader automatically manages its state when the container dispatches these custom events:

- `thumbnail:loading` — starts a 1s delay before showing the animation.
- `thumbnail:loaded` — triggers the completion sequence and fade-out.

Both the `lazy_images_controller` and `thumbnail_size_controller` already emit these events. Controllers in other areas can adopt the same pattern to reuse the animation.

### Image Viewer

The primary gallery photo viewer (`image_viewer_controller.js`) now renders the shared loader on both the hero frame and the thumbnail strip. The controller manages loader state internally—no extra markup beyond the partial is needed. When adding new viewer panes, render the partial and call `attachImageLoader(img, container)` after inserting your `<img>` element so the loader can coordinate the fade.

## Behavior

- **Deferred reveal**: the overlay only appears if loading exceeds one second.
- **Variant completion**: the orbit shrinks behind the 🆗 emoji as the new thumbnail fades in.
- **Graceful fade**: the loader cross-fades out while the image opacity returns to 1, avoiding abrupt cuts.

## Styling

Loader styles live in `app/assets/tailwind/application.css`. If you need to adjust colors or timing for another feature, prefer adding modifier classes around the shared partial rather than editing the base selectors.

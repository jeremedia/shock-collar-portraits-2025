Your Shock Collar Portrait is Ready!
=====================================

Hello!

Remember that afternoon at when you let a stranger wrap a dog shock collar around a neck and shock you while another stange person took your portrait while yet another strange person else blasted you with air? If not... not sure how you ended up on this list. But if so, your portrait is ready!

We tried to keep the email-to-session straight but that didn't happen. So you'll have to scroll through them to find yours. Sorry about that! One day we'll have a better system. If you remember the day you were shocked, that might help.

Browse them all:
<%= @heroes_url %>

If after downloading you'd like your portrait removed from the app, send me the url. There is no public gallery.

Thank you for trusting us with your portrait and for being part of this project!

With electric love,
MR OK & the OKNOTOK Team

Your Shock Collar Portrait is Ready!
=====================================

Hello!

Remember that afternoon when you let a stranger wrap a dog shock collar around your neck and shock you while another strange person took your portrait while yet another strange person blasted you with air?

If not... not sure how you ended up on this list. Let's assume you remember: your portrait is ready.

We tried to keep the email-to-session matching straight but that didn't happen. So you'll have to scroll through the portraits to find yours. One day we'll have a better system. If you remember the day you were shocked, that might help.

Click here to set up your account and browse all the portraits:
<%= accept_invitation_url(@resource, invitation_token: @token) %>

<% if @resource.admin? %>
Note: This invite grants admin access. After you accept, visit <%= admin_help_url %> to see the quick guide for choosing hero photos and applying tags.
<% end %>

<% if @resource.invitation_due_at %>
This invitation expires on <%= l(@resource.invitation_due_at, format: :long) %>
<% end %>

Thank you for trusting us with your portrait and for being part of this fun project.

With electric love,
MR OK & the OKNOTOK Team
